## Lights

Who doesn't like movies? This is an interesting introduction about the movie industry and why it is important. The multi-'million dollar' question is how to predict how a movie will perform for reasons that I need to research.

## Camera
I have always been a huge fan of movies, so when I saw [ The Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) on Kaggle, I took advantage of the opportunity to explore my interest while learning more about exploratory data analysis. The dataset is a combination of data collected from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (The Movie Database) API and [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). 

Out of the 5 unique csv files included in the dataset, I used the following: 
> 1. movies_metadata.csv - The primary Movies Metadata file that includes 24 columns of information on 45k+ movies.
> 2. ratings.csv - Ratings from GroupLens users

There were also files containing movie plot keywords, credits, and links to all the movies in the Full MovieLens dataset. I might explore these further when I learn about NLP.

## Action

I utilized [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/coxem14/Capstone-1/blob/main/MoviEDA.ipynb) for my analysis, and consolidated the functions I wrote to aid in data cleaning, data manipulating, and plotting into my [movies.py](https://github.com/coxem14/Capstone-1/blob/main/movies.py) file.

## Proposal: MoviEDA

Some ideas to explore:

> * Various relationships between movie budget, revenues, genres, ratings, release date, production company, and language.
> * How have budgets and revenues for movies changed over time? 
> * Are there relationships between the budget for a movie and how much revenue it generates? 
> * Do certain genres of movies generate more revenue than others? Higher ratings than others?
> * Does runtime impact budget, revenue, or rating?
